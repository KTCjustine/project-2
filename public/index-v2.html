                                        <p>Emma told me, "Mark and I were constantly arguing about money. He would be mad at me for buying something I wanted because we didn't have the money, and he didn't think it was necessary. Then, he would buy something more expensive, and I would get angry and feel like he disregarded my wants and needs. We couldn't afford to take vacations very often. If the car broke down, we would have to put it on a credit card that was always near maxed out.</p>

                                        <p>Life wasn't fun. Mark and my relationship was strained with money problems until my friend told me to read something from Dr. Michael J. Duckett. I was skeptical and didn't want to get into any money-making scheme. To my surprise, Dr. Duckett's approach wasn't a money scam at all! His idea was straightforward and individualized. It had nothing to do with recruiting other people. I was making $800 at my job, working 45 hours weekly. After following Dr. Duckett's program for one month, working six hours a week, I made $600 weekly. After three months, I worked three hours per day and made $1500 per week! I love the work, too! I knew it was helping people, and that's what I really love to do.</p>

                    <p>I've found the best way to make a difference in people's lives is through life coaching. I'm passionate about life coaching because it is simple to learn and positively affects people's lives. I've trained and certified more than 5,000 life coaches around the world. Although some people want to call me the leading expert on life coaching, I call myself a servant to humankind.</p>
                    <p>I serve the world with life coaching and teach life coaches how to quickly create a thriving practice—even part-time! I have experienced first-hand that when people improve their lives individually, the world becomes a better place collectively. Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?</p>

                        <p>If you take your biggest life challenge right now, ask yourself how much you would pay someone to help solve your biggest problem. Would you pay someone $50, $100, $500, or more if you knew that person could help eliminate your problem? Of course, you would. This is why clients pay life coaches at least $100 per hour and meet with them weekly. The clients get much more value from their life coach than it costs them.</p>
                        <p>If your clients could have done better on their own, they would have done it by now. As a life coach, your training will enable you to use specialized techniques that look at the "big picture" in a person's life and help the client see things that weren't obvious.</p>

The frustration of saying 'no' to them asking me for a simple candy bar was unbearable.</p>                        
                        <p class="text-[16px] md:text-[24px] font-bold">Jim and I knew we both had to work and have someone watch our young children. Still, even with two incomes, we barely made enough to pay the bills. We didn't have any extra money for anything. Jim earned $800 per Week, and I made $600.</p>
                        <p class="text-[16px] md:text-[24px] font-bold">After paying our bills, we felt poor. I knew an extra $500 a week could change everything. I came across Dr. Michael J. Duckett's life coach training. It was so simple and super fun.</p>

                    <p class="font-bold">I completed the training in one week. After stumbling around for the first two weeks trying to start the business, I joined Dr. Duckett's twice weekly Zoom meetings, which he does with all his certified life coaches. That helped me launch my practice quickly.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold">I decided to skip the $50 per hour learning stage and started charging $100 per hour for new clients, and the new clients started coming fast. I just followed the unbelievably easy process for attracting clients like a magnet.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold">I also got referrals directly from Dr. Duckett's Life Coach Group. By the third week, I was making $500 per week. By the sixth week, I quit my job, and now I’m working 10 hours per week, making $1,000 weekly. I get to spend the rest of the time with my kids!</p>
                    <p class="font-bold">I do my telephone life coaching sessions after I tuck the kids into bed at night. They take just two hours (50 minutes each session, to be exact), and now we are no longer missing out on living a good life—we're finally thriving!"</p>
                    <p>The coolest part of Sarah's story is that she shared it with some of her friends, who experienced similar results!</p>

                        <p class="font-bold">Dr. Michael J. Duckett's online life coach training sounded simple enough that I could do it, and the price was doable." I liked the self-paced training so that I could fit it into my schedule. I was blown away by all the cool psychology and practical coaching techniques the course taught me. I went from barely making enough money on my job to earning an extra $1,000 weekly in my spare time. Life coaching is fun, rewarding, and prestigious! Becoming a life coach was the best thing I've ever done. By the way, I'm now engaged! Yup, I found that special gal!</p>

It's also a waste of time doing quirky little things like having to look at the person next to you in the training and say, "You are good and deserve more." What? This behavior is strange and wastes precious time and money for the attendees.</p>
                        <p>After taking these expensive life coach trainings, I didn't feel ready to coach others. That's why I got with some of my friends who were top-rated psychologists to create a life coach system that is SELF-PACED, simple to learn, and can help ANYONE become a life coach in as little as 1-7 weeks. The seven lessons are 11 videos (an average of 20 minutes per video) and a workbook. If you want to get through the course fast, you can finish 1 lesson daily. I made the lessons informative, fun, and easy to learn.</p>

                                    <p><b>Did you know money isn't real?</b> It is just something we place value on in our minds. If you have a $100 bill, go to the store and give it to the cashier. The cashier runs one of those pens across it, and it turns black, which indicates the $100 bill is counterfeit. What value do you and the cashier place on that same piece of paper? Right. It has become worthless because you both realize there isn't any value in it. The paper stayed the same. It is just the thinking about the value that has changed.</p>
                                    <p>The same goes for <i>money</i> in our life. If we want more money, we must learn how to shift our thinking around it. I have plenty of information for you and your clients on this subject.</p>

                                <p>Also, <b>Lesson 3</b> teaches powerful communication skills for the life coach. To become a master communicator, you learn the essence of communication, from specific eye contact to improve communication to the ARC (Affinity, Reality, and Communication).</p>
                                <p>One of the things you will learn about eye contact is switching eyes when you speak and listen with another person. When you speak to someone, you should look into the other person's left eye with your right eye. When you listen to someone, you should look into their right eye with your left eye. This can improve your communication with the other person by up to 10 times.</p>

                        <p>Initially, we will ask you to do <b>3-5 free <i>intern sessions</i></b> to prove to yourself how easy it is to be a life coach.</p>
                        <p>Most of the time, these initial free sessions are done with family and friends. You quickly discover how much great information you've learned in the training and feel capable of handling almost any client that comes before you.</p>
                        <p>After the initial 3-5 free Intern sessions, most life coaches charge $50 per session for the first 30-60 days. Doing one 50-minute session daily, Monday through Saturday, is $300 weekly. That's an extra $1,200 per month right from the start! After 60 days, most coaches increase their hourly rate to $100 per hour because their schedule fills up and their confidence quickly grows.</p>

                        <p>Over 5,000 life coaches were sitting right where you are now at one time in their lives. They wondered if this was doable or if life coaching was the right part-time (or full-time) gig for them.</p>
                        <p>Many people have walked away from getting this course and continue to financially struggle to this day. <b>If nothing changes—nothing changes.</b></p>
                        <p>I made this course so simple that a child could quickly learn it. I included everything you will need to become another success story of people who have taken this course and become successful life coaches.</p>
                        <p>I temporarily discounted the price for this training to $599 because of the massive demand for coaches! I will raise the price when we have enough coaches to handle the client demand. Don't wait. Get in while the course is temporarily on sale at a drastically discounted price.</p>

                        <p>Life coaching is very natural. It is best explained by the old saying, "Life coaching is a heart-to-heart profession." I will teach you numerous coaching techniques that will make you feel like a pro in no time. I'll share many coaching exercises to help your clients overcome major lifeblocks.
                        <p class="italic">Here's an example of a coaching exercise:</p>
                        <div class="flex flex-col gap-[20px] md:gap-[30px]">

                                    <p><b>Discovering your Shadow Side:</b> Think of someone who hurt you the most in your past. This hurtful person is someone you might even hate. Next, write down everything you don't like or hate about that person. The more things you identify, the better.
                                    <p>Now, take a look at that list. At some time in the past, you possessed some version of each trait. This exercise helps us understand how we all carry inner programming (a shadow side) that could negatively impact our lives.</p>
                                    <p>When you identify your shadow side, you can do things to work around it. Your underlying negative traits will no longer hold you back from making progress. This exercise is one of many life coaching processes you will learn to use with your clients.</p>

                        <p>As I previously mentioned about the longer training, most extended trainings were fun, but I filled them with irrelevant fluff. We would whoop and holler, give massages to each other's shoulders, share stories, and things like that.</p>
                        <p>I thought, what if I cut out all the fluff and just gave the coaches the good stuff? The real stuff that will empower them to become the best life coaches in the industry. Since I've trained thousands of life coaches and have had thousands of clients, I know what works and what is fluff. That's why I created this Fast Life Coach Training.</p>
                        <p>It's simple but powerful. It's easy and fast to learn. It is easy for coaches to get thoroughly trained and certified in a matter of days or weeks</p>
                        <p>Our organization specializes in helping individuals quickly launch new careers and improve their financial health. Get trained and certified in as fast as a week! Join us and start making a real difference in your financial future today.</p>

                            <p class="md:mt-[35px]">More than any time in history, people need life coaching.</p>
                            <p>Life has become more complicated and confusing than ever before. People are struggling financially and can't figure out what to do on their own.</p>
                            <p>Pandemics, a worldwide recession, and inflated pricing on everything cause people to struggle more financially and emotionally. When people feel hopeless, life coaches can help them on many levels to create a brighter future.</p>
                            <p>Research shows there will continue to be a shortage of life coaches for at least 30 years! While some people complain about life, life coaches help people turn complaints into dreams and dreams in reality.</p>

If I were your coach, I would tell you, "Look, you want an extra $300-$500 per week, you don't have a lot of time to make that kind of money, and life coaching has been around for many years helping people…." I would tell you, make a positive change by enrolling in this course now.</p>

                            <p>I thought about enrolling to become a life coach, but I said, ‘Maybe I'll do this later, but not now.’</p>
                            <p>I came across the website again recently.</p>
                            <p>I needed to find a way to earn an extra $400 per week to cover my bills.</p>
                            <p>I enrolled this time, and within 30 days, I worked only six hours per week, earning more than I needed! I regret I didn't enroll sooner. This course is the real thing!!! I see why they offer a money-back guarantee—who wouldn't be happy with this course? It is fantastic to be a certified life coach with ICS Research because they are there to help you along the way!"</p>
